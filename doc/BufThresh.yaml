  This class implements a simple Buffer preprocessor, by replacing values under a threshold by 0s. It is part of the :fluid-topic:`FluidDecomposition` of `Guides/FluCoMa`. For more explanations, learning material, and discussions on its musicianly uses, visit http://www.flucoma.org/

  The process will return a buffer with the same size and shape than the requested range.

parameters:
  source:
    description: |
      The index of the buffer to use as the source material to be processed.
  startFrame:
    description: |
       The starting point (in samples) from which to copy in the source buffer.
  numFrames:
    description: |
       The duration (in samples) to copy from the source buffer. The default (-1) copies the full lenght of the buffer.
  startChan:
    description: |
       The first channel from which to copy in the source buffer.
  numChans:
    description: |
       The number of channels from which to copy in the source buffer. This parameter will wrap around the number of channels in the source buffer. The default (-1) copies all of the buffer's channel.
  destination:
    description: |
      The index of the buffer to use as the destination for the processed material.
  threshold:
    description: |
      The threshold under which values will be zeroed
