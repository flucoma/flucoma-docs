digest: Extract every N samples / channels from a buffer
species: buffer-proc
sc-categories: FluidCorpusManipulation

see-also: BufSelect
description: |
  Pick every N frames and / or channels from a buffer, described in terms of independent hop sizes for frames and channels
  
parameters:
  source:
    description: |
      The |buffer| to pick values from 
  startFrame:
     description: |
         The starting point (in samples) from which to copy in the source buffer.
  numFrames:
     description: |
         The duration (in samples) to copy from the source buffer. The default (-1) copies the full length of the buffer.
  startChan:
     description: |
         The first channel from which to copy in the source buffer.
  numChans:
     description: |
         The number of channels from which to copy in the source buffer.  
  destination:
    description: |
      The |buffer| to write the selected data to
  frameHop:
    description: |
      Take every `frameHop` frames. Default = 1 = all frames (where 2 would be every other frame, etc.)
  chanHop:
    description: |
      Take every `chanHop` channels. Default = 1 = all channels (where 2 would be every other channel, etc.)
