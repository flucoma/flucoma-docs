:description: 

    Perform regression between :fluid-obj:`DataSet`\s using N parallel 1-to-1 polynomial regressors in one object.

:discussion:

    A polynomial regressor is a very simple algorithm that, given a set of input-output pairs - ``x`` to ``y``, for example - will find the line of best fit for that data. Linear regression is a special case when the ``degree`` of the polynomial is ``1``, meaning the line of best fit will be straight.

    Essentially, each element of each input is mapped to the corresponding element of the same output, hence it needing to be an N-to-N corpus, which is one limitation of this algorithm.
    Tikhonov regularisation is an improvement of this algorithm, which compensates for noisy data and reduces overfitting in certain situations, a good explanation of how this works can be found on wikipedia (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ridge_regression#Tikhonov_regularization)

:control degree:

    An integer that specifies the degree \(highest power of x\) that the fit polynomial will have; e.g. a degree of 2 means that the polynomial will have a form ``y = \alpha + \beta x + \gamma x^2``. Therefore the higher the degree, the closer the output will get to the original data (until it begins overfitting).

:control tikhonov:

    A floating point value that describes the strength of the Tikhonov filter, namely how much the algorithm is penalised for overfitting to the data

:message fit:

   :arg sourceDataSet: Source data

   :arg targetDataSet: Target data
   
   Fit the polynomial to map between a source and target :fluid-obj:`DataSet`

:message predict:

   :arg sourceDataSet: Input :fluid-obj:`DataSet`

   :arg targetDataSet: Output :fluid-obj:`DataSet`

   Apply the regressed mapping to a :fluid-obj:`DataSet` and predict the output value for each point

:message predictPoint:

   :arg sourceBuffer: Input point

   :arg targetBuffer: Output point

   Apply the regressed mapping to a single data point in a |buffer|

:message clear:

   This will erase all the learned polynomials.

:message print:

    Print object information to the console.

:message read:

    :arg fileName: file to read from (optional, will prompt if not present)

    load regressed polynomials from a json file on disk

:message write:

    :arg fileName: file to write to (optional, will prompt if not present)

    write current regression to a json file on disk
