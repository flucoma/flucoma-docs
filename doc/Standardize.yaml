digest: Standardize a FluidDataSet
sc-categries: FluidManipulation
sc-related: Classes/FluidDataSet, Classes/FluidStandardize

description: |
  Standardize a :fluid-obj:`DataSet`, i.e. rescale using its mean(s) and standard deviation(s) in each dimension.

  See http://www.faqs.org/faqs/ai-faq/neural-nets/part2/section-16.html

parameters:
  invert:
    description: |
      The direction in which the standardization will occur for transform and transformpoint. The default 0 is taking in the range of the input used to fit and transforms it towards the standardized range. A value of 1 will expect an input of the standardized range to transform back to the original range.
