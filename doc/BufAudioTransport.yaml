parameters:
  source1:
    description: |
      The first source buffer
  startFrame1:
    description: |
      offset into the first source buffer (samples)
  numFrames1:
    description: |
      number of samples to use from first source buffer
  startChan1:
    description: |
      starting channel of first source buffer
  numChans1:
    description: |
      number of channels to process in first source buffer
  source2:
    description: |
      the second source buffer
  startFrame2:
    description: |
      offset into the second source buffer (samples)
  numFrames2:
    description: |
      number of samples to process from second buffer
  startChan2:
    description: |
      starting channel for second buffer
  numChans2:
    description: |
      number of channels to process in second buffer
  destination:
    description: |
      buffer for interpolated audio
  interpolation:
    description: |
      The amount to interpolate between A and B (0-1, 0 = A, 1 = B)
  bandwidth:
    description: |
      Someone tell me
  windowSize:
    description: |
       The window size. As spectral differencing relies on spectral frames, we need to decide what precision we give it spectrally and temporally, in line with Gabor Uncertainty principles. http://www.subsurfwiki.org/wiki/Gabor_uncertainty
  hopSize:
    description: |
       The window hop size. As sinusoidal estimation relies on spectral frames, we need to move the window forward. It can be any size but low overlap will create audible artefacts. The -1 default value will default to half of windowSize (overlap of 2).
  fftSize:
    description: |
       The inner FFT/IFFT size. It should be at least 4 samples long, at least the size of the window, and a power of 2. Making it larger allows an oversampling of the spectral precision. The -1 default value will use the next power of 2 equal or above the highest of windowSize and (bandwidth - 1) * 2.
  maxFFTSize:
    description: |
      How large can the FFT be, by allocating memory at instantiation time. This cannot be modulated.
