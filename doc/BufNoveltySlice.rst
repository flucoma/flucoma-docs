:description: A non-realtime slicer using an algorithm assessing novelty in the signal to estimate the slicing points.
:discussion: 
   A novelty curve is derived from running a kernel across the diagonal of the similarity matrix, and looking for peaks of changes. It implements the seminal results published in  'Automatic Audio Segmentation Using a Measure of Audio Novelty' by J Foote.

   The process will return a buffer which contains indices (in samples) of estimated starting points of different slices.

      The argument for ``algorithm`` can be passed as an integer (see table below), or as one of the following symbols: ``\spectrum``, ``\mfcc``, ``\chroma``, ``\pitch``, or ``\loudness``. 

:process: This is the method that calls for the slicing to be calculated on a given source buffer.
:output: Nothing, as the various destination buffers are declared in the function call.


:control source:

   The buffer to use as the source material to be sliced through novelty identification. The different channels of multichannel buffers will be summed.

:control startFrame:

   Where in the srcBuf should the slicing process start, in samples.

:control numFrames:

   How many frames should be processed.

:control startChan:

   For multichannel srcBuf, which channel should be processed.

:control numChans:

   For multichannel srcBuf, how many channels should be summed.

:control indices:

   The buffer where the indices (in samples) of the estimated starting points of slices will be written. The first and last points are always the boundary points of the analysis.

:control algorithm:

   The feature on which novelty is computed.

   :enum:

      :0:
         Spectrum – The magnitude of the full spectrum.

      :1:
         MFCC – 13 Mel-Frequency Cepstrum Coefficients.

      :2:
         Chroma - The contour of a 12-band chromagram.

      :3:
         Pitch – The pitch and its confidence.

      :4:
         Loudness – The true peak and loudness.

:control kernelSize:

   The granularity of the window in which the algorithm looks for change, in hops. A small number will be sensitive to short term changes, and a large number should look for long term changes.

:control threshold:

   The normalised threshold, between 0 and 1, on the novelty curve to consider it a segmentation point.

:control filterSize:

   The size (in hops) of a smoothing filter that is applied on the novelty curve. A larger filter size allows for cleaner cuts on very sharp changes.

:control minSliceLength:

   The minimum duration of a slice in number of hops.

:control windowSize:

   The window size. As novelty estimation relies on spectral frames, we need to decide what precision we give it spectrally and temporally. For more information visit https://learn.flucoma.org/learn/fourier-transform/

:control hopSize:

   The window hop size. As novelty estimation relies on spectral frames, we need to move the window forward. It can be any size, but low overlap will create audible artefacts.

:control fftSize:

   The inner FFT/IFFT size. It should be at least 4 samples long, at least the size of the window, and a power of 2. Making it larger allows an oversampling of the spectral precision.

:control maxFFTSize:

   How large can the FFT be, by allocating memory at instantiation time. This cannot be modulated.

:control maxKernelSize:

   This cannot be modulated.

:control maxFilterSize:

   This cannot be modulated.

:control action:

   A Function to be evaluated once the offline process has finished and indices instance variables have been updated on the client side. The function will be passed indices as an argument.
