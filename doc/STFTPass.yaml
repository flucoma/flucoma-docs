parameters:
  in:
    description: |
      The input to be passed-through
  windowSize:
    description: |
      The size of the buffered window to be analysed, in samples. It will add that much latency to the signal.
  hopSize:
    description: |
      How much the buffered window moves forward, in samples. The -1 default value will default to half of windowSize (overlap of 2).
  fftSize:
    description: |
      How large will the FFT be, zero-padding the buffer to the right size, which should be bigger than the windowSize argument, bigger than 4 samples, and should be a power of 2. This is a way to oversample the FFT for extra precision. The -1 default value will default to windowSize.
  maxFFTSize:
    description: |
      How large can the FFT be, by allocating memory at instantiation time. This cannot be modulated.
output: Same as input, delayed by the windowSize.
sc-code: |
  Summing with the inverse (gain of -1) with a delay of the latency gives us CPU-expensive silence.
