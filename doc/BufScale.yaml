description: |
  Scale |buffer| values from an input range to an output range.

discussion: |
  This object is for scaling |buffer| values. It copies data from a source |buffer| to a destination |buffer|, scaling the source from an input range to an output range.
  
parameters:
  source:
    description: |
      This is the method that calls for the scaling to be calculated on a given source buffer.
  startFrame:
    description: |
       The starting point (in samples) from which to copy in the source |buffer|.
  numFrames:
    description: |
       The duration (in samples) to copy from the source |buffer|. The default (-1) copies the full length of the |buffer|.
  startChan:
    description: |
       The first channel from which to copy in the source |buffer|.
  numChans:
    description: |
       The number of channels from which to copy in the source |buffer|. This parameter will wrap around the number of channels in the source |buffer|. The default (-1) copies all |buffer| channels.
  destination:
    description: |
      The destination |buffer|.
  inputLow:
    description: |
      The low reference value of the input scaling range.
  inputHigh:
    description: |
      The high reference value of the input scaling range.
  outputLow:
    description: |
      The low reference value of the output scaling range.
  outputHigh:
    description: |
      The high reference value of the output scaling range.
  clipping:
    description: |
      Optional clipping of the input (and therefore of the output). 0 is none. 1 clips the lowest input at inputLow. 2 caps the highest input at inputHigh, 3 caps both input low and high value within the described range.
