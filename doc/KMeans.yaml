description: |
  Uses the K-Means algorithm to learn clusters from a :fluid-obj:`DataSet`

  https://scikit-learn.org/stable/tutorial/statistical_inference/unsupervised_learning.html#clustering-grouping-observations-together

parameters:
  numClusters:
    description: |
      The number of clusters to classify data into.
  maxIter:
    description: |
      The maximum number of iterations the algorithm will use whilst fitting.
messages:
  fit:
   description: |
      Identify `numClusters` clusters in a :fluid-obj:`DataSet`. It will optimise until no improvement is possible, or up to `maxIter`, whichever comes first. Subsequent calls will continue training from the stopping point with the same conditions.
   args:
    - name: dataSet
      description: |
        A :fluid-obj:`DataSet` of data points.
    - name: action
      description: |
        A function to run when fitting is complete, taking as its argument an array with the number of data points for each cluster.
  predict:
   description: |
      Given a trained object, return the cluster ID for each data point in a :fluid-obj:`DataSet` to a :fluid-obj:`LabelSet`.
   args:
    - name: dataSet
      description: |
        A :fluid-obj:`DataSet` containing the data to predict.
    - name: labelSet
      description: |
        A :fluid-obj:`LabelSet` to retrieve the predicted clusters.
    - name: action
      description: |
        A function to run when the server responds.
  fitPredict:
   description: |
      Run :fluid-obj:`KMeans#*fit` and :fluid-obj:`KMeans#*predict` in a single pass: i.e. train the model on the incoming :fluid-obj:`DataSet` and then return the learned clustering to the passed :fluid-obj:`LabelSet`
   args:
    - name: dataSet
      description: |
        A :fluid-obj:`DataSet` containing the data to fit and predict.
    - name: labelSet
      description: |
        A :fluid-obj:`LabelSet` to retrieve the predicted clusters.
    - name: action
      description: |
        A function to run when the server responds
  predictPoint:
   description: |
      Given a trained object, return the cluster ID for a data point in a |buffer|
   args:
    - name: buffer
      description: |
        A |buffer| containing a data point.
    - name: action
      description: |
        A function to run when the server responds, taking the ID of the cluster as its argument.
  transform:
   description: |
      Given a trained object, return for each item of a provided :fluid-obj:`DataSet` its distance to each cluster as an array, often reffered to as the cluster-distance space.
   args:
    - name: srcDataSet
      description: |
        A :fluid-obj:`DataSet` containing the data to transform.
    - name: dstDataSet
      description: |
        A :fluid-obj:`DataSet` to contain the new cluster-distance space.
    - name: action
      description: |
        A function to run when the server responds.
  fitTransform:
   description: |
      Run :fluid-obj:`KMeans#*fit` and :fluid-obj:`KMeans#*transform` in a single pass: i.e. train the model on the incoming :fluid-obj:`DataSet` and then return its cluster-distance space in the destination :fluid-obj:`DataSet`
   args:
    - name: srcDataSet
      description: |
        A :fluid-obj:`DataSet` containing the data to fit and transform.

        A |buffer| containing a data point.
    - name: targetBuffer
      description: |
