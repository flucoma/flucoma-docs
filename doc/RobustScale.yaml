digest: Apply Robust Scaling to a FluidDataSet
species: data
sc-categories: FluidManipulation

description: |
  Scales the entries of a FluidDataSet, or scales a data point according to the learned values of a data set. It will centre the median of each dimension to 0, and will scale the data to +/- the provided centiles, by default providing the first and third qartile (25 and 75).

  See https://scikit-learn.org/stable/auto_examples/preprocessing/plot_all_scaling.html#robustscaler

parameters:
  low:
    description: |
      The low centile boundary, default 25.
  high:
    description: |
      The high centile boundary, default 75.
  invert:
    description: |
      The direction in which the scaling will occur for transform and transformpoint. The default 0 is taking in the range of the input used to fit and transforms it towards the robust scaling range. A value of 1 will expect an input of the scaling range to transform back to the original range.
