digest: KD Tree on the server
sc-categries: FluidManipulation
sc-related: Classes/FluidDataSet
see-also: 
description: |
  A server-side K-Dimensional tree for efficient neighbourhood searches of multi-dimensional data.

  See https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/neighbors.html#nearest-neighbor-algorithms for more on KD Trees

parameters:
  numNeighbours:
    description: |
      The number of neighbours to return.
  lookupDataSet:
    description: |
      An optional :fluid-obj:`FluidDataSet` from which data points will be returned for realtime queries. This does not need to be the same DataSet that the tree was fitted against, but does need to have matching labels. Using this mechanism, we have a way to, e.g. associate labels with segments of playback buffers, without needing pass strings around the server.
messages: 
  fit:
   description: |
      Build the tree by scanning the points of a :fluid-obj:`FluidDataSet`
   args:
    - name: dataset
      description: |
        The :fluid-obj:`FluidDataSet` of interest. This can either be a data set object itself, or the name of one.
    - name: action
      description: |
        A function to run when indexing is complete.
  kNearest:
   description: |
      Returns the IDs of the `k` points nearest to the one passed.
   args:
    - name: buffer
      description: |
        A |buffer| containing a data point to match against. The number of frames in the buffer must match the dimensionality of the :fluid-obj:`FluidDataSet` the tree was fitted to.
    - name: action
      description: |
        A function that will run when the query returns, whose argument is an array of point IDs from the tree's :fluid-obj:`FluidDataSet`
  kNearestDist:
   description: |
      Get the distances of the K nearest neighbours to a point.
   args:
    - name: buffer
      description: |
        A |buffer| containing a data point to match against. The number of frames in the buffer must match the dimensionality of the :fluid-obj:`FluidDataSet` the tree was fitted to.
    - name: action
      description: |
        A function that will run when the query returns, whose argument is an array of distances.
