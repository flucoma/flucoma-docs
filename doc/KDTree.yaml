digest: Efficient lookup of data using a k-d tree.

description: |
  A k-dimensional tree for efficient neighbourhood searches of multi-dimensional data.
discussion: |
  :fluid-obj:`KDTree` facilitates efficient nearest neighbour searches of multi-dimensional data stored in a :fluid-obj:`DataSet`. By first "fitting" the :fluid-obj:`KDTree`, querying for nearest neighbours is possibly made much quicker at the time of searching. 

  Whilst k-d trees can offer very good performance relative to naïve search algorithms, they suffer from something called “the curse of dimensionality” (like many algorithms for multi-dimensional data). In practice, this means that as the number of dimensions of your data goes up, the relative performance gains of a k-d tree go down.
parameters:
  numNeighbours:
    description: |
      The number of neighbours to return.
  dataSet:
    description: |
      An optional :fluid-obj:`DataSet` from which data points will be returned for realtime queries. This does not need to be the same DataSet that the tree was fitted against, but does need to have matching labels. Using this mechanism, we have a way to, e.g. associate labels with segments of playback buffers, without needing pass strings around.
messages:
  fit:
   description: |
      Build the tree by scanning the points of a :fluid-obj:`DataSet`
   args:
    - name: dataSet
      description: |
        The :fluid-obj:`DataSet` of interest. This can either be a data set object itself, or the name of one.
    - name: action
      description: |
        A function to run when indexing is complete.
  kNearest:
   description: |
      Returns the identifiers of the `k` points nearest to the one passed.
   args:
    - name: buffer
      description: |
        A |buffer| containing a data point to match against. The number of frames in the buffer must match the dimensionality of the :fluid-obj:`DataSet` the tree was fitted to.
    - name: action
      description: |
        A function that will run when the query returns, whose argument is an array of point identifiers from the tree's :fluid-obj:`DataSet`. The returned identifiers are always type symbol, therefore would need to be converted to a number type if intended to be used in that way.
  kNearestDist:
   description: |
      Get the distances of the K nearest neighbours to a point.
   args:
    - name: buffer
      description: |
        A |buffer| containing a data point to match against. The number of frames in the buffer must match the dimensionality of the :fluid-obj:`DataSet` the tree was fitted to.
    - name: action
      description: |
        A function that will run when the query returns, whose argument is an array of distances.
