digest: A Perceptually Spread Spectral Contour Descriptor in Real-Time

description: Amplitude for a number of equally spread perceptual bands.
discussion: |
  The spread is based on the Mel scale (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mel_scale) which was one of the first attempts to mimic pitch perception scientifically. This implementation allows to select the range and number of bands dynamically.

  The process will return a multichannel control steam of size maxNumBands, which will be repeated if no change happens within the algorithm, i.e. when the hopSize is larger than the server's kr period.
process: The audio rate in, control rate out version of the object.
parameters:
  in:
    description: |
      The audio to be processed.
  numBands:
    description: |
      The number of bands that will be perceptually equally distributed between minFreq and maxFreq. It is limited by the maxNumBands parameter. When the number is smaller than the maximum, the output is zero-padded.
  minFreq:
    description: |
      The lower boundary of the lowest band of the model, in Hz.
  maxFreq:
    description: |
      The highest boundary of the highest band of the model, in Hz.
  maxNumBands:
    description: |
      The maximum number of Mel bands that can be modelled. This sets the number of channels of the output, and therefore cannot be modulated.
  normalize:
    description: |
      This flag enables the scaling of the output to preserve the energy of the window. It is on (1) by default.
  scale:
    description: |
           This flag sets the scaling of the output value. It is either linear (0, by default) or in dB (1).
  windowSize:
    description: |
      The window size. As spectral description relies on spectral frames, we need to decide what precision we give it spectrally and temporally, in line with Gabor Uncertainty principles. http://www.subsurfwiki.org/wiki/Gabor_uncertainty
  hopSize:
    description: |
      The window hop size. As spectral description relies on spectral frames, we need to move the window forward. It can be any size but low overlap will create audible artefacts. The -1 default value will default to half of windowSize (overlap of 2).
  fftSize:
    description: |
      The inner FFT/IFFT size. It should be at least 4 samples long, at least the size of the window, and a power of 2. Making it larger allows an oversampling of the spectral precision. The -1 default value will default to windowSize.
  maxFFTSize:
    description: |
      How large can the FFT be, by allocating memory at instantiation time. This cannot be modulated.
output: |
  A  KR signal of maxNumBands channels, giving the measure amplitudes for each band. The latency is windowSize.
