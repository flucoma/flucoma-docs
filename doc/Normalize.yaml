digest: Normalize a FluidDataSet
species: data
sc-categories: FluidManipulation
sc-related: Classes/FluidStandardize, Classes/FluidDataSet
see-also:
description: |
  Normalize the entries of a :fluid-obj:`DataSet`, or normalize a data point according to the learned bounds of a data set.

parameters:
  min:
    description: |
      Minimum output value, default 0
  max:
    description: |
      Maximum output value, default 1
  invert:
    description: |
      The direction in which the normalization will occur for transform and transformpoint. The default 0 is taking in the range of the input used to fit and transforms it towards the normalised range. A value of 1 will expect an input of the normalized range to transform back to the original range.

  fit:
   description: |
      Compute the normalization factors from a :fluid-obj:`DataSet` for later.
