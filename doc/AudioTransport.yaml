  Interpolates between the spectra of two sounds using the Optimal Transport algorithm
parameters:
  in2:
    description: |
      Source B
  interpolation:
    description: |
      The amount to interpolate between A and B (0-1, 0 = A, 1 = B)
  windowSize:
    description: |
       The window size in samples. As HPSS relies on spectral frames, we need to decide what precision we give it spectrally and temporally, in line with Gabor Uncertainty principles. http://www.subsurfwiki.org/wiki/Gabor_uncertainty
  hopSize:
    description: |
       The window hop size in samples. As HPSS relies on spectral frames, we need to move the window forward. It can be any size but low overlap may create audible artefacts. The -1 default value will default to half of windowSize (overlap of 2).
  fftSize:
    description: |
       The inner FFT/IFFT size. It should be at least 4 samples long; at least the size of the window; and a power of 2. Making it larger than the window size provides interpolation in frequency. The -1 default value will use the next power of 2 equal or above the windowSize.
  maxFFTSize:
    description: |
       How large can the FFT be, by allocating memory at instantiation time. This cannot be modulated.
