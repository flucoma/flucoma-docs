description: |
  Flatten a multichannel |buffer| to a single channel. This can be useful for constructing n-dimensional data points for use with :fluid-obj:`DataSet`

  The `axis` determines how the flattening is arranged. The default value, 1, flattens channel-wise, such that (if we imagine channels are rows, time positions are columns):

   ===  ===  ===
   a 1  a 2  a 3
   b 1  b 2  b 3
   c 1  c 2  c 3
   ===  ===  ===


  becomes

   ===  ===  ===  ===  ===  ===  ===  ===  ===
   a 1  b 1  c 1  a 2  b 2  c 2  a 3  b 3  c 3
   ===  ===  ===  ===  ===  ===  ===  ===  ===


  whereas with `axis = 0` we get

   ===  ===  ===  ===  ===  ===  ===  ===  ===
   a 1  a 2  a 3  b 1  b 2  b 3  c 1  c 2  c 3
   ===  ===  ===  ===  ===  ===  ===  ===  ===
