    description: |
      The number of dimensions to reduce to
messages:
  fit:
   description: |
      Train this model on a :fluid-obj:`DataSet` but don't transform the data
   args:
    - name: dataSet
      description: |
        A :fluid-obj:`DataSet` to analyse
    - name: action
      description: |
        Run when done
  transform:
   description: |
      Given a trained model, apply the reduction to a source :fluid-obj:`DataSet` and write to a destination. Can be the same for both input and output (in-place). Returns the fraction of accounted variance, aka the fidelity of the new representation: a value near 1.0 means a higher fidelity to the original.
   args:
    - name: sourceDataSet
      description: |
        Source data, or the DataSet name
    - name: destDataSet
      description: |
        Destination data, or the DataSet name
    - name: action
      description: |
        Run when done
  fitTransform:
   description: |
      :fluid-obj:`PCA#fit` and :fluid-obj:`PCA#transform` in a single pass. Returns the fraction of accounted variance, aka the fidelity of the new representation: a value near 1.0 means a higher fidelity to the original.
   args:
    - name: sourceDataSet
      description: |
        Source data, or the DataSet name
    - name: destDataSet
      description: |
        Destination data, or the DataSet name
    - name: action

        Run when done
  transformPoint:
   description: |
      Given a trained model, transform the data point in a |buffer| and write to an output buffer.
   args:
    - name: sourceBuffer
      description: |
        Input data
    - name: destBuffer
      description: |
        Output data
