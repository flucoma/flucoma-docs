description: |
  FluidDataSet is a container associating data points with identifiers.

parameters:
  name:
    description: |
      The name of the FluidDataSet. This is unique between all FluidDataSets.

messages:
  addPoint:
   description: |
      Add a new point to the FluidDataSet. The dimensionality of the FluidDataSet is governed by the size of the first point added. If the identifier already exists, or if the size of the data does not match the dimensionality of the FluidDataSet an error will be reported.
   args:
    - name: identifier
      description: |
        The identifier for the point.
    - name: buffer
      description: |
        A |buffer| containing the data for the point.
    - name: action
      description: |
        A function to run when the point has been added.
         ​​
  updatePoint:
   description: |
      Update an existing identifier's data. If the identifier does not exist, or if the size of the data does not match the dimensionality of the FluidDataSet an error will be reported.
   args:
    - name: identifier
      description: |
        The identifier for this point.
    - name: buffer
      description: |
        A |buffer| containing the data for the point.

  getPoint:
   description: |
      Retrieve a point from the data set into a |buffer|. If the identifier does not exist an error will be reported.
   args:
    - name: identifier
      description: |
        The identifier for the point to be retrieved.
    - name: buffer
      description: |
        A |buffer| where the retrieved data will be stored.

  deletePoint:
   description: |
      Remove a point from the data set. If the identifier doesn't exist an error will be reported. ​​
   args:
    - name: identifier
      description: |
        The identifier to be deleted.

  setPoint:
   description: |
    Set the point. If the identifier exists, this method behaves like updatePoint. If the identifier doesn't exist, it behaves like addPoint.
   args:
    - name: identifier
      description: |
        The identifier for this point.
      
    - name: buffer
      description: |
        A |buffer| containing the data for the point.

  clear:
   description: |
      Empty the data set. ​
   args:
  toBuffer:
   description: |
    Dump the content of the dataset to a |buffer|, with optional transposition, and a map of frames/channel to the original IDs as a FluidLabelSet.
   args:
    - name: buffer
      description: |
        The buffer to write to. It will be resized.
    - name: transpose
      description: |
        If 0, each dataset point becomes a buffer frame, and each dataset dimension becomes a buffer channel. If 1, points become channels, and dimensions become frames.
    - name: labelSet
      description: |
        The FluidLabelSet in which to dump the point's IDs associated with their reference frame number (or channel number if transposed).
    - name: action
      description: |
        A function to run when the point has been added.
  fromBuffer:
   description: |
    Import to the dataset the content of a |buffer|, with optional transposition, and a map of frames/channels to the original IDs as a FluidLabelSet.
   args:
    - name: buffer
      description: |
        The buffer to read from. The dataset will be resized.
    - name: transpose
      description: |
        If 0, each buffer frame becomes a dataset point, and each buffer channel becomes a dataset dimension. If 1, channels become points, and frames become dimensions.
    - name: labelSet
      description: |
        The FluidLabelSet from which to retrieve the point's IDs associated with their reference frame number (or channel number if transposed).
    - name: action
      description: |
        A function to run when the point has been added.
  getIds:
   description: |
    Export to the dataset identifier to a FluidLabelSet.
   args:
    - name: labelSet
      description: |
        The FluidLabelSet to export to. Its content will be replaced.
    - name: action
      description: |
        A function to run when the export is done.
  merge:
   description: |
      Merge sourceDataSet in the current DataSet. It will update the value of points with the same identifier if overwrite is set to 1. ​To add columns instead, see the 'transformJoin' method of FluidDataSetQuery.
   args:
     - name: sourceDataSet
       description: |
         The source DataSet to be merged.
     - name: overwrite
       description: |
         A flag to allow overwrite points with the same identifier.
     - name: action
       description: |
         A function to run when the merge has happened. ​​
  print:
   description: |
      Post an abbreviated content of the DataSet in the window by default, but you can supply a custom action instead. ​​
   args:
  server:
   description: |
      The server instance the object uses .
