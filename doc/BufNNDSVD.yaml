  See http://nimfa.biolab.si/nimfa.methods.seeding.nndsvd.html

parameters:
  source:
    description: |
      The index of the buffer to use as the source material to be decomposed through the NMF process. The different channels of multichannel buffers will be processing sequentially.
  bases:
    description: |
      The index of the buffer where the different bases will be written to and/or read from: the behaviour is set in the following argument.
  activations:
    description: |
      The index of the buffer where the different activations will be written to and/or read from: the behaviour is set in the following argument.
  minComponents:
    description: |
      Minimum number of estimated components
  maxComponents:
    description: |
      Maximum number of estimated components
  coverage:
    description: |
      Fraction (0 to 1) of information preserved in the decomposition
  method:
    description: |
      The method used for the decomposition. Options are:
  windowSize:
    description: |
       The window size. As spectral differencing relies on spectral frames, we need to decide what precision we give it spectrally and temporally, in line with Gabor Uncertainty principles. http://www.subsurfwiki.org/wiki/Gabor_uncertainty
  hopSize:
    description: |
       The window hop size. As sinusoidal estimation relies on spectral frames, we need to move the window forward. It can be any size but low overlap will create audible artefacts. The -1 default value will default to half of windowSize (overlap of 2).
  fftSize:
    description: |
       The inner FFT/IFFT size. It should be at least 4 samples long, at least the size of the window, and a power of 2. Making it larger allows an oversampling of the spectral precision. The -1 default value will use the next power of 2 equal or above the highest of windowSize and (bandwidth - 1) * 2.
