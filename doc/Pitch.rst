:description: Three popular monophonic pitch descriptors, all of which compute frequency and confidence.
:discussion: 

  :fluid-obj:`Pitch` returns both ``pitch`` and ``confidence`` values. When no pitch can be detected, a pitch of 0 Hz is returned (or -999.0 when the unit is in MIDI note mode).
  
  For information about the pitch descriptor algorithms, see the ``algorithm`` parameter below.
  
  The "confidence" output is a value between 0 and 1 indicating how confident the algorithm is in the pitch that it is reporting. In effect this can be an estimation of how "noisy" (closer to 0) or "harmonic" (closer to 1) the spectrum is. The confidence may also be low when a signal contains polyphony, as the algorithms are not intended for multiple pitch streams.
  
  The ``unit`` argument indicates whether the pitch output should be in hertz (indicated by 0) or MIDI note numbers (indicated by 1). MIDI note numbers may be useful, not only because of their direct relationship to MIDI-based synthesis systems, but also because of the logarithmic relationship to hertz, making them perceptually evenly-spaced units (1 MIDI note = 1 semitone).

:process: The audio rate in, control rate out version of the object.

:output: The two descriptors: [pitch, confidence]. The latency is windowSize.

:control in:

   The audio to be processed.

:control algorithm:

   The algorithm to estimate the pitch. (The default is 2.) The options are:

   :enum:

      :0:
         Cepstrum: Returns a pitch estimate as the location of the highest peak (not including DC) in the Cepstrum of the signal.

      :1:
         Harmonic Product Spectrum: Implements the Harmonic Product Spectrum algorithm for pitch detection . See e.g. A. Lerch, "An Introduction to Audio Content Analysis: Applications in Signal Processing and Music Informatics." John Wiley & Sons, 2012.https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/book/10.1002/9781118393550

      :2:
         YinFFT: Implements the frequency domain version of the YIN algorithm, as described in P. M. Brossier, "Automatic Annotation of Musical Audio for Interactive Applications.‚Äù QMUL, London, UK, 2007. See also https://essentia.upf.edu/documentation/reference/streaming_PitchYinFFT.html

:control minFreq:

   The minimum frequency that the algorithm will search for. This sets the lowest value that can be generated. The default is 20.

:control maxFreq:

   The maximum frequency that the algorithm will search for. This sets the highest value that can be generated. The default is 10000.

:control select:

   An array of ``symbols`` indicating which analyses to return. The options are ``pitch`` and ``confidence``. If nothing is specified, the object will return all the analyses. The analyses will always appear in their normal order, this argument just allows for a selection of them to be returned. Reordering the options in this argument will not reorder how the analyses are returned.

:control unit:

   The unit of the pitch output. The default of 0 indicates output in Hz. A value of 1 will output MIDI note values.

:control windowSize:

   The window size. As sinusoidal estimation relies on spectral frames, we need to decide what precision we give it spectrally and temporally, in line with Gabor Uncertainty principles. http://www.subsurfwiki.org/wiki/Gabor_uncertainty

:control hopSize:

   The window hop size. As sinusoidal estimation relies on spectral frames, we need to move the window forward. It can be any size but low overlap will create audible artefacts. The -1 default value will default to half of windowSize (overlap of 2).

:control fftSize:

   The inner FFT/IFFT size. It should be at least 4 samples long, at least the size of the window, and a power of 2. Making it larger allows an oversampling of the spectral precision. The -1 default value will default to windowSize.

:control maxFFTSize:

   How large can the FFT be, by allocating memory at instantiation time. This cannot be modulated.
