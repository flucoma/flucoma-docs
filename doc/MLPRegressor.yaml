digest: Regression with a multi-layer perceptron
species: data
sc-categories: Machine learning
sc-related: Classes/FluidMLPClassifier, Classes/FluidDataSet
see-also: 
description: |
  Perform regression between :fluid-obj:`DataSet`\s using a Multi-Layer Perception neural network.

parameters:
  hidden:
    description: |
      An `Classes/Array` that gives the sizes of any hidden layers in the network (default is two hidden layers of three units each).
  activation:
    description: |
      The activation function to use for the hidden layer units. Beware of the permitted ranges of each: relu (0->inf), sigmoid (0->1), tanh (-1,1)
  outputActivation:
    description: |
      The activation function to use for the output layer units. Beware of the permitted ranges of each: relu (0->inf), sigmoid (0->1), tanh (-1,1)
  tapIn:
    description: |
      The layer whose input is used to predict and predictPoint. It is 0 counting, where the default of 0 is the input layer, and 1 would be the first hidden layer, and so on.
  tapOut:
    description: |
      The layer whose output to return. It is counting from 0 as the input layer, and 1 would be the first hidden layer, and so on. The default of -1 is the last layer of the whole network.
  maxIter:
    description: |
      The maximum number of iterations to use in training.
  learnRate:
    description: |
      The learning rate of the network. Start small, increase slowly.
  momentum:
    description: |
      The training momentum, default 0.9
  batchSize:
    description: |
      The training batch size.
  validation:
    description: |
      The fraction of the DataSet size to hold back during training to validate the network against.
messages: 
  fit:
   description: |
      Train the network to map between a source and target :fluid-obj:`DataSet`
   args:
    - name: sourceDataSet
      description: |
        Source data
    - name: targetDataSet
      description: |
        Target data
    - name: action
      description: |
        Function to run when training is complete
  predict:
   description: |
      Apply the learned mapping to a :fluid-obj:`DataSet` (given a trained network)
   args:
    - name: sourceDataSet
      description: |
        Input data
    - name: targetDataSet
      description: |
        Output data
    - name: action
      description: |
        Function to run when complete
  predictPoint:
   description: |
      Apply the learned mapping to a single data point in a |buffer|
   args:
    - name: sourceBuffer
      description: |
        Input point
    - name: targetBuffer
      description: |
        Output point
    - name: action
      description: |
        A function to run when complete
  clear:
   description: |
      This will erase all the learning done in the neural network.
   args:
    - name: action
      description: |
        A function to run when complete
