  Perform cross-synthesis using Nonnegative Matrix Factorization (NMF) and Optimal Transport (OT). NMF analyses of `source` and `target` sounds decompose their material in to a selectable number of components, which are in turn represented by their *bases* (spectrum) and *activations* (temporal pattern of each component).

  `FluidNMFMorph` provides the ability to interpolate between `source` and `target` spectra using a technique called Optimal Transport, that provides richer results than a simple linear interpolation between spectral shapes. The resulting sound is built up using a buffer of temporal activations, then resynthesised using a phase estimate.

parameters:
  source:
    description: |
      A |buffer| with the spectral bases for the source sound.
  target:
    description: |
      A |buffer| with the spectral bases for the target sound.
  activations:
    description: |
      A |buffer| with the temporal activations for the target sound.
  autoassign:
    description: |
      If set to `1` the algorithm will attempt to optimally match which NMF basis components from source and target best match each other, and will use this mapping as its basis for interpolation.
  interp:
    description: |
      Set the relative contributions of `source` and `target` between 0 and 1.
  windowSize:
    description: |
      The analysis window size in samples. Needs to match that of the seeding NMF analyses
  hopSize:
    description: |
      The analysis hop size in samples. Needs to match that of the seeding NMF analyses
  fftSize:
    description: |
      The analysis FFT size in samples. Needs to match that of the seeding NMF analyses
